            <h1 align="center">What Fleming Systems can provide for you.</h1>
            <p align="center" style="font-size: larger;">
                Do you have a project that needs to be completed? How about something that has never worked quite as
                you expected? Routine IT maintenance being neglected?
                Do you not have the ability to hire an Internal IT employee? You're not alone, and that's why I started
                Fleming Systems.
            </p>
            <p align="center" style="font-size: larger;">
                I can assist you with any of that, I put the focus where your business needs it by implementing or
                improving existing IT infrastructure. My service is only successful if you do not have to think about
                IT.
                Whether you're looking to expand your current IT infrastructure and/or maintain it in a more reasonable way I can assist.
                I am all for automation and moving forward with today's
                new technologies that can ease the daily headache of having to manage servers in the office and the
                maintenance that comes with them.
