            <h1 align="center">What Fleming Systems can provide for you.</h1>
            <p align="center" style="font-size: larger;">
                Do you have a project that needs to be completed? How about something that has never worked quite as
                you expected? Routine IT maintenance being neglected?
                Do you not have the ability to hire an Internal IT employee? You're not alone, and that's why I started
                Fleming Systems.
            </p>
            <p align="center" style="font-size: larger;">
                I can assist you with any of that, I put the focus where your business needs it by implementing or
                improving existing IT infrastructure. My service is only successful if you do not have to think about
                IT.
                who wants to either expand their current IT infrastructure and/or maintain it in a more reasonable way.
                I am all for automation and moving towards
                new technologies that can ease the daily headache of having physical server in the office and the
                maintenance that coems with it.
