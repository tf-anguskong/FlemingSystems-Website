### What's wrong with me!

I finally caved and bought a macbook pro 13". I've been wanting to try out Mac OS for the longest time and I figured the responsible thing to do with starting the company was to keep everything related to Fleming Systems physically separated from everything else. It's on it's trial run, you get 14 days to return Apple products so I got some time to learn it. The previous complaints of the keyboard for the macbooks also scared me off previously, but this new 2020 keyboard feels great. 

It all started when I first got into Linux about a year ago and fell in love with the power Linux can provide. However, my day job was and still does involve 99% administration of Microsoft Windows. Sure I could do all of this through Remote Desktop, but that's awful! Not that MacOS allows me to really do anything differently but MacOS DOES have the office suite and my daily life very much consists of Outlook. Also creating client facing documents is much better to do from Microsoft Word than Libreoffice...

There is a lot going on here within MacOS, I still haven't quite figured out how to setup a keyboard shortcut to open terminal... but Spotlight is nice and seems to be able to find whatever I need when I ask it. 

Side Note: They came with some Air Pods, too bad I run a Pixel 4 XL! Seem to work great on the macbook though. 


#### Sidecar!!!!

Another big boon for me is Sidecar, I have had an iPad for years now and it's great. Allowing me to used the iPad as a secondary screen is really nice. I really see it being useful on the road when I'm stuck in a server room. Having a second, wireless, battery powered display is pretty sweet!

#### Dictation with Siri

I have found myself recently complaining about how my Windows machine dictation didn't seem to exist natively... it may have at one point. But being able to press function twice to have siri dictate an email is very nice! It also seems to understand me pretty well.
