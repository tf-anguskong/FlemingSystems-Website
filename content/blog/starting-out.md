# Starting out with Fleming Systems

I had never really considered starting a business of my own... granted this is a company of me, myself, and I. But I have learned quite a bit since I first started two weeks ago, to include legally and technically.

* Legally, there are a few things I had to do. 
    * I learned how to form my own LLC and register it with the state of Washington. [WA CCFS](https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/). There are fees to do this, not sure if they are always the same but I had to pay ~$200. 
    * Get an EIN from the feds [EIN Registration](https://irs-ein-tax.com/?msclkid=35cc802735ab1079b634df2bf1d895ca&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=EIN%20Grouping&utm_term=%2Bregister%20%2Bein&utm_content=EIN%20%23%20Register), this only took about five minutes. You will need this for tax purposes and to open a business bank account. 
    * Still in the process of trying to open a true business bank account with a bank. Still undetermined on which bank to use... I blame COVID. :weary:

* Technical/Fun
    * In order to host the website you are currently reading this on (for free I might add!), I learned how to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [Github](https://github.com/) + [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I love the functionality this gives me and for the cost of free 99 I can't complain! Being able to write the code on my machine, push to my git repo, then netlify updates the live site within seconds is truly amazing.
        * Using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) as IDE 
    * Setting up my Phone System using [3CX](https://www.3cx.com/); also free. 
        * Setting up my SIP provider, small monthly fee for the phone number. 
    * Utilizing third party solutions for booking appointments and contact form on the website.
        * [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) -- Contact Form
        * [Picktime](https://www.picktime.com/) -- Appointment Booking
    * Free stock photos for various pictures through the site from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/)
    * Creating my company logo with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0/)
    * I'm not much of an accountant... but I am trying to track all my expenses and what not in [Gnu Cash](https://gnucash.org/), a free accounting software. 

Of course all the technical services I have listed have much larger paid services for use, however for a small business I have effectively cost all my maintenance costs to under $10 a month.

There is a lot going on and a lot of things I have had setup previously, like my Office 365 tenant and email. I am enjoying myself so far and now I have to figurue out how to market myself a bit more. Business Cards are being printed now!
