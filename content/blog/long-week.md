# It's been a long week, but a good one

I've spend a day rewriting a lot of my old powershell scripts and what I call functionized them, as they were honestly an awful mess to read. I have a script that pulls a report from ADP on a daily basis an updates Active Directory accordingly. Maybe one day I will divulge it, as it is to this day my most useful script; it is essentially responsible for keeping all employee contact and organizational information correct. 

I've also taken the liberty of further enhancing our Asset Management through ManageEngine's ServiceDesk Plus.

On the business side I've continued to setup what I believe I need, which seems to be a lot of Google sided things like their Ads, and Analytics (yes on this site) to view if anyone has or is even reading this post! 

I'm also continuing to really explore into Microsoft Azure's DevOps options, their devops portal is pretty cool but as I was never really a developer I need to keep working with these tools to truly grasp everything about them. There are usually two types of people in DevOps:

* The Developer that moves towards Systems
* The Systems Administrator that moves towards Development

I am defintiely the latter, although I truly started with Networking and Telecommunications while in the Army. There is not enough time in the day to explore everything that I want to learn.
