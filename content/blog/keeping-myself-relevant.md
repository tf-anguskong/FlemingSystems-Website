# How does one do it?

With everything technology today, how does one keep themselves relevant with all the information out there! How do you know what you want to spend time reading on, where do you find this information? My answer? I don't! I like to read up on anything related to technology, but I am constantly finding myself having to google information whenever I work on something, be it the first time I've done it or the 100th! 

There are a few key resources I like to look at day to day though to keep myself updated:

* Reddit!
    * [Sysadmin subreddit](reddit.com/r/sysadmin)
        * Great for reading daily to see any new technology affecting the daily sysadmin. Also great to check if you think there is a widespread outage. 
    * [Homelab subreddit](reddit.com/r/homelab)
        * Alright, this is more for fun. There are a lot of cool things that people do with their computers at home. I've also discovered a lot of new services that I had never heard of before I had joined the community. My homelab includes a single custom built machine using Proxmox and hosting various services. 
* Youtube
    * [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips)
        * Another things I like to watch for enjoyment and also most of the time to learn something. They have multiple channels that serve various purposes. I.E. [TechLinked](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeFfhMcJa1kjtfZAGskOCA) is great as they have a show Mon/Wed/Fri for any recent news in the tech world!
        * They also have the WAN show podcast and (my favorite) CarpoolCritics, which is a hilarious podcasts about movies; which in now way is related to technology but great for a commute!
    * Let's be honest there are a lot of channels that I subscribe to on youtube and I try to watch a video or two a day about something. I have recently (the last year or so) really been getting into Linux and development.
