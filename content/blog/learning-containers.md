Today my goal was to use docker + Azure to get a web app deployed to Microsoft Azure's web apps. After about 2 hours and some reading I was able to get through it!

It should also be noted that before today I have briefly messed with Docker containers in the past but hadn't quite understood the power of containers. I'm happy to report that I have become a fan! 

### Requirements

* Azure Subscription
    * You should be ok with a trial account, but to connect to the Azure shell that it uses in the tutorial you need to spin up a storage account in Azure. 
* GitHub (for the way I went about this)
* Web App (There is a basic free version that you can run for 30 days.)

### Resources

* Used a quick walkthrough from [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/deploy-run-container-app-service/1-introduction), this was very easy to use and walkthrough with. They also provide a git rep to clone if you don't have your own repo to pull the docker image from.
