My name is Tyler Fleming and I have been working in the IT field since 2011. It started with my time in the Army as a 25N (Joint Nodal Network Operator; really it was networking and phone systems). Since then I have moved towards Cloud Services and Server Infrastructure, to include physical servers and cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure.

I am currently attending College to obtain my BAS in Systems Administration and Cybersecurity, to be completed in Winter 2021. I am continuuosly learning new technology, my most recent endeavor was setting up this website using Hugo and Netlify!
