My name is Tyler Fleming and I am the founder of Fleming Systems and (currently) the only employee. I have been working in the IT field since 2011. It started with my time in the Army as a 25N and got out in 2016. Since then I have moved towards Cloud Services and Server Infrastructure, to include physical servers and cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure. I hope that you and I can work together to improve your current IT processes or implement new ones to expand your own business.
