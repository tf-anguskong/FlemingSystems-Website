My name is Tyler Fleming and I have been working in the IT field since 2011. It started with my time in the Army as a 25N (Joint Nodal Network Operator; really it was networking and phone systems). It was there that I realized my passion for all things technology. Since then I have really moved towards Cloud Services and Server Infrastructure, to include physically and cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure.

I am currently attending College to obtain my BAS in Systems Administration and Cybersecurity, to be completed in Winter 2021. I am continuuosly learning new technology, my most recent endeavor was setting up this website using Hugo and Netlify!

Here are a few subjects I am proficient in:

---

* Windows Services, to include back to Windows Server 2008 R2
* Virtualization with Microsoft Hyper-V
* Microsoft SCCM, now known as Endpoint Manager. To include integration with Microsoft Intune. 
* Windows Automation with Powershell
* Microsoft Office 365
    * Exchange Online
* Microsoft Azure Infrastrucure Services
* Microsoft Azure Active Directory
* Datacenter Networking Operations
