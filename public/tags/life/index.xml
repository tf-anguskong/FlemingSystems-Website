      <description>Hello there! What brought you here? Was it Google?! Let&amp;rsquo;s hope so since apparently how google ads work is pay to click! I hope you even send me an email or give me a call via the contact page! I offer free 30 minute consultation over Microsoft Teams or a simple phone call. Thanks COVID!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long week, but a good one I&amp;rsquo;ve spend a day rewriting a lot of my old powershell scripts and what I call functionized them, as they were honestly an awful mess to read.

Maybe one day I will divulge it, as it is to this day my most useful script; it is essentially responsible for keeping all employee contact and organizational information correct.</description>
